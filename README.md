# MAPS
This is a program, that takes randomly some roads (the quantity of the randomly taken roads is equal to quantity of vertexes // 2), takes randomly any number from 1 to  10 (it will be the traffic minute), creates a traffic in that roads. After that it adds the traffic minute to the main minute that approximately would be taken for driving by the current road. After that program asks user - 'You want to know the shortest path or the path that will take for crossing the minimal time? and shows the choice of the user (shows path (for ex. a -> b -> c->) and the distance or time, it depends on user's choice.)
